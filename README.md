# Rent A Car

We are currently in the development phase of our Rent a Car project, dedicated to delivering an advanced car rental platform tailored for the Tobeto ecosystem. Built upon Java Spring Boot and React technologies, the project aims to establish a robust foundation, ensuring a fast and reliable reservation process. By harnessing the capabilities of the Java Spring Boot framework, we are committed to creating an efficient and seamless experience for users. Simultaneously, with the integration of the React library, our focus is on crafting a user-friendly and interactive interface.

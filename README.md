# Rent A Car

We, as Java and React full-stack developers, are currently developing a cutting-edge Rent a Car project under Tobeto's umbrella. This initiative is a vital part of our training, tailored specifically for Tobeto's educational ecosystem. Our focus is on creating an advanced car rental platform, ensuring a swift reservation process and a seamless user experience. Leveraging Java Spring Boot and React technologies, we are dedicated to delivering a top-notch solution that aligns with Tobeto's standards.
